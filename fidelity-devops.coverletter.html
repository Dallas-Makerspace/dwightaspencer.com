<p>I am interested in the DevOp Engineer. My resume is enclosed for your
review. Given my related experience and excellent capabilities I would
appreciate your consideration for this opportunity. My skills are an ideal
match for this position.</p>

<p>As your next DevOp Engineer, I plan on working closely with each project role
members, documenting the customer's requirements, assisting role members in
peer programming sessions, and teaching role members as needed to help take
what could be a daunting three week project cycle down to less than thirty
minutes by using automation tools and best practices where needed.</p>

<p>One example of this is while I was working at Lockheed Martin where I
developed an automation process and procedure for their migration of Windows
XP systems over to Windows 7 which took a eight month long project down to
only five weeks.</p>

<p>Another example would be while at CompuTEK Industries. I pioneered several
programs for clients under a managed DevOp Engineer service to migrate and
implement their entire infrastructure and application development under a
cloud based environment where we used CentOS, Puppet, VMware, Git, Jenkins,
Gitolite, and a few custom rails applications to deploy and manage the
client's application.</p>

<p>While at Firehost I worked with a small team that maintained eight data
centers across the world that followed a ITIL SLA model of service with PCI 3
compliant hosting of Windows Server, Linux (Redhat, Centos, and Ubuntu) virtual
servers powered by VMWare EXSI and Puppet provision system. I also worked
very closely with several customers to analyse traffic usage, performance
metrics and develop a SEIM implementation and compacity plan based on thier 
usage and project needs.</p>

<p>I have attached my curriculum vitae, a list of projects I have contributed
to or developed are on my github page at http://github.com/denzuko,
and a list of references can be viewed on my linkedin page at
http://linkedin.com/in/denzuko. Thank you for your consideration. I look
forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
